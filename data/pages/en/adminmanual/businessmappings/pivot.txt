====== Pivot View Mapping ======

The purpose of this mapping is to define a pivot view report of the records of a module. This map is in the "View Business Map" category as it serves the purpose of showing the records of a module in a different way than we usually see them in the list view.

With this map, we will be able to divide the records into columns based on the distinct values in a field of the module as well as filter the records based on a search or custom view settings.

As usual, the map to apply is selected using the name of the map which must be **{ModuleName}_Pivot** and you can use the global variable **BusinessMapping_{ModuleName}_Pivot** to define maps based on user and roles (among other escalation rules) just like most of the other maps.

The accepted format is:
<code xml>
<map>
	<module>Module name</module>
	<filter>filter name</filter>
        <aggregate>field name</aggregate>
	<rows>
		<row>
			<name>value of module field name</name>
			<label>label of field in the table</label>
		</row>
	</rows>
	<cols>
		<col>
			<name>value of module field name</name>
			<label>label of field in the table</label>
		</col>
	</cols>
</map>
</code>

This is a test map you can use to see it in action.

<code XML>
<map>
<module>Accounts</module>
<filter>All</filter>
<aggregate>employees</aggregate>
<rows>
		<row>
			<name>accounttype</name>
                        <label>Account Type</label>
		</row>
		<row>
			<name>rating</name>
                        <label>Rating</label>
		</row>
</rows>
<cols>
		<col>
			<name>industry</name>
                        <label>lndustry</label>
		</col>
</cols>
</map>
</code>
