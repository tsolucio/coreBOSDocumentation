====== Google Calendar Sync: Separating Events/Calendars ======

??? The problem I am facing is that personal events that I have on my Google calendar are showing up on my task list in coreBOS. How can I get this to stop? I do not keep 2 calendars and I prefer to work with only one. I see in calendar settings that "Google is connected" for my user name. Is this why my task list is picking up everything from my Google calendar?

!!! The solution to this is to create different calendars in google and different activity types in coreBOS to separate work events from personal events.

  * Go to your Google Calendar
  * On the left list of "My Calendars" click on the dropdown icon and select the "Create Calendar" option
  * Give it a name, select the other options you need and save
  * Pick a color for the calendar by clicking on the calendar name
  * Create your personal events on this new calendar
  * As long as you do not sync any of the coreBOS Calendar types all the events on the personal calendar will stay only on Google Calendar
