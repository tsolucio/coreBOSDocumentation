===== Web service libraries =====

In order to make programming with the web service API easier, we have created an abstraction library that hides the details of connection and low-level conversation going on and permits us to create applications faster.

For example, instead of going through the two-step login process, we can use the library and simply call **doLogin**, that method will execute the tow-step process and return the result.

In a similar manner, we can execute **doUpdate** and not have to worry if it is a GET or a POST nor if we have to add the session id to the call.

We have libraries for many languages and they all follow a similar structure which is the method prefixed with "do":

  * doLogin
  * doListTypes
  * doDescribe
  * doCreate
  * doRetrieve
  * doQuery
  * doInvoke

There are many of these functions and depending on the maintenance team of each library there will be more or less.

One very important function is **doInvoke** which permits us to execute any web service method.

^Method:|doInvoke|
^Purpose:|Execute any web service method.|
^Profile:|doInvoke(method:string, parameters:array, type:string):array|
^Parameters:| => method: name of the method to execute \\ => parameters: array with the parameter needed by the method \\ => type: GET or POST|
^Response:|the response of the method called|
