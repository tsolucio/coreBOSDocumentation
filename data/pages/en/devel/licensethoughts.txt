====== My understanding of the License ======

  * Initial developer permits us to do whatever we want with the code: use it, sell it, rebrand it, modify it, but always under the same conditions of the license
  * Contributor permits us to do whatever we want with their MODIFICATIONS: use them, sell them, rebrand them, modify them, but always under the same conditions of the license
  * since both previous points impose that the user MUST not suffer any change in their liberties. This point makes it incompatible for the MODIFICATIONS to have a GPL license because the whole work would be affected
  * we HAVE THE OBLIGATION of giving ALL our MODIFICATIONS in source code, we can not encrypt them nor change their license
  * if we do a larger work, the VPL code described above cannot be restricted, in other words, anybody MUST have access to original code and ALL it's MODIFICATIONS
  * we MUST detail all code modifications
  * the code can be dual-lincesed but only vtiger can do that
  * "Modifications" This is a very important definition, as it specifies precisely what code you write must be made available and what you can keep proprietary.
    * Anything termed a "Modification" must be made available in source code form to anyone to whom you give a binary. The following defines a Modification:
      * If you change anything within one of the files contained in the Source Code, that is a Modification.
      * If you take code out of one of the files contained in the Source Code and place it in a new file, whether you add new code or not, that is a Modification.
      * If you rename a file or combine two or more files contained in the Source Code, that is a Modification.
