====== Duplicate Merging ======
Duplicate record detection gives you the capability to detect and handle duplicate record. The merge feature helps you manage system storage consumption and maintain data quality by freeing the system from old, obsolete, or invalid data. Detection rules can be defined for different record types, including custom entities etc.
=== Feature ===
Using Duplicate merge functionality user can merge two records found in any module and can deactivate the duplicate record. This feature queries your database in search of duplicate records. When you find and merge duplicate record information, the duplicated records are then removed from vtiger, and only the relevant record and data is retained. User can choose master record at the end which will remain active and other will get deactivated. 

=== Modules Supported ===

  - Automatic merge.

If user select manual merge it shows all duplicate records in imported records with Entity Type as Existing or Imported now. While merging user can not select just imported record as parent record.

Finding and merging duplicate records is optional while importing. In import step 3 user can select merge option otherwise it will work like normal import. But if user select auto merge it will show two options 
  - Skip duplicate record – which will skip all duplicate records in imported file.
  - Overwrite duplicate records - will overwrite the existing duplicate record with imported record.
