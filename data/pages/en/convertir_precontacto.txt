??? I define a profile where I deactivate the top options of see and use all and then all the modules except Accounts, Contacts and Leads.

Then I go to any Lead but the Convert Lead action is not there. Why?

I can only see the link if I activate see and use all, but then I also see al the modules, which I do not want.

!!! I just tried and it worked correctly for me.

The problem must be with some field the conversion needs.

I had a look at the code and it says that the "Convert Lead" action will be visible when all these conditions are met:

  * the user has edit permission on Accounts, Contacts and Leads
  * the user must have conversion tool permission in his profile (see image below)
  * Accounts and Contacts modules are active
  * the Lead hasn't been converted previously
  * the field "Company" on the lead is not empty
