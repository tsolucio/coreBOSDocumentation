====== Description =====

==== Customized On-Demand CRM ====

Each time the admin user tries to create a new user, first they get a license screen that informs them of the extra charge for each user and asks them to confirm, if they do then they are taken to the normal user creation screen.

Upon user creation, the new user is created normally and all the information is sent to a centralized coreBOS (ODController) and inserted into this new ODUser module which holds the basic information of the new user.

When a user is eliminated from the client's CRM, the elimination request is sent to the central coreBOS (ODController) and the user is marked as eliminated with the date of elimination.

Create a service cron in the client's CRM that connects once a month to the central ODController and writes the space consumed by the storage directory and eliminates temporal files

Todo

  * add check box for acceptance
  * change the label to Accept
  * send new user info to ODController
  * send delete user info to ODController
  * prepare diff for other OD setups
  * space service cron

==== Customized ODController ====

  * We add our clients to Accounts, with additional information for OD service control
  * We install the module ODUser, such that one Account has many ODUsers and one ODUser has one Account
  * We create a new recurring invoice cron to generate an invoice for all accounts that are active. This invoice will create one product line for each non-deleted ODUser associated with the account and, as an option, add another product line for space consumption if this is important
  * These invoices will be automatically sent by email using GenDoc workflow

Todo

  * add new ODControl block in Accounts
    * start date of OD service
    * end date of OD service
    * deactivated
    * space consumed up to now
    * invoice with tax
    * frequency
  * add uitype 10 to accounts on user
  * new module ODUser
  * invoicing cron

==== Setup process ====

We create a website service with which a client can start his OD CRM install and start working. This will be a webform with the necessary information to automatically create the account in ODController, verify payment (if necessary), and automatically execute the necessary steps to have his ODCRM install ready for use.

  * Install ODUser
  * Create web service user
  * Configure mods2sync
  * Configure CentralSync
  * Install CentralSync in On-Demand coreBOS

Todo
  * webform
    * invoice with tax
  * process webform
    * create account
    * user
      * create user account
      * update install x_syncuser
