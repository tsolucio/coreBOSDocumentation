    * storage
    * test/logo
    * user_privileges (overwrite any existing files)
    * config.inc.php
    * and any non standard modules that you may have:
      * for example, PDFMaker would require that you copy:
        * modules/PDFMaker
        * Smarty/templates/PDFMaker
      * if you have others, then you copy their directories
  * edit config.inc.php
    * change the database access to point to the database copy and $site_url and $root_directory accordingly
  * <del>edit vtigerversion.php and change the version to 5.4</del>
  * copy build/HelperScripts/installupdater.php to the root of your install and execute it: <code>http://your_server/your_install/installupdater.php</code>
  * now log in as admin to make sure you are working ok: you can log in and the initial home page appears
  * go to coreBOS updater
  * click on "Load Updates"
  * click on "Apply All". Note that you may have to do this a few times to get all the changes applied as there are some dependencies. Also there will be some SQL errors because we have a set of changes that cover many different cases and your install is different for sure.
